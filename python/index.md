# Python Bindings for EFL

If coding in C is not quite your cup of tea then you can use the [Python Bindings](https://build.enlightenment.org/job/base_pyefl_build/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/build/sphinx/html/index.html) to develop in a python environment.

As well as providing a direct bindings for all the native libraries there is a great collection of [Elementary extensions](https://github.com/JeffHoogland/python-elm-extensions)
being created by [Jeff Hoogland](http://jeffhoogland.blogspot.co.uk/) which could speed up your application UI creation.
